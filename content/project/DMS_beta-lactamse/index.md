<h2>Identifying evolutionary trade-offs of an antibiotic resistance enzyme using deep mutational scanning
---
<p>Trade-offs present an evolutionary challenge in which gaining a beneficial trait involves losing another. This compromise can prevent organisms from acquiring beneficial traits. In preliminary work, we found evidence of antibiotic resistance trade-offs, both antagonistic and synergistic pleiotropy, in different beta-lactam drug environments among a small set of clinically characterized TEM-1 variants. It raises the question, can we use known trade-offs to predict short-term evolutionary outcomes? We are using a high-throughput technology, deep mutational scanning, to explore the activity of all single step variants in the TEM-1 beta-lactamase enzyme towards a diverse panel of beta-lactam drugs. A population containing all single amino acid variants is exposed to a drug and deep sequenced to quantify enrichment and depletion of variants. Fitness effects in each drug environment are then used to identify the form (antagonistic and synergistic) and magnitude of pleiotropy between beta-lactam drugs. Knowledge of the local sequence-function landscape will allow us to exploit potential constraints and make short-term predictions. We explore the evolution of TEM-1 resistance when exposed to different drug cocktails designed using information from the local fitness landscape. We predict that resistance will arise more slowly when populations are exposed to drug pairs where TEM-1 exhibits antagonistic pleiotropy creating an evolutionary tradeoff.<p>
