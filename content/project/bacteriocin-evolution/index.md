<h2> A toxin that is its own antidote

<p>Protein-protein interactions present an evolutionary challenge in which if one of the proteins mutates it can impair function of the complex. Diversification of protein-protein pairs has produced an array of unique sets of interacting proteins. It raises the question; how can these lock and key proteins evolve and diversify? This paradox is present in the colicin-immunity system in Escherichia coli. Colicin is a toxin produced by the host to kill neighboring susceptible cells. The immunity protein that is specific to the colicin toxin allows a cell to bind the colicin protein and survive. The colicin-immunity complex has evolved and diversified multiple times resulting in highly specific protein-protein interactions. The standing hypothesis for diversification proceeds through immunity mutations which allows the immunity to bind multiple colicins with the second step arising via mutation in the colicin restoring tight, specific binding. In recent work in the lab, a first step mutation in colicin has been identified which unexpectedly allows the producing cell to survive, susceptibility of ancestral immunity cells by the mutated colicin, but also protection to the producing cell from many other related colicins. Contrary to the standing hypothesis, the “cloaking” exhibited by the producing cell with the mutant colicin isn’t due to broadened immunity or chromosomal resistance, but through the colicin itself. Currently, we are exploring the mechanism of “cloaking” and how a lineage would be “un-cloaked” (via complementary mutations in immunity). We predict that colicin-immunity evolution can proceed through a colicin-led mutational path contrary to the standing hypothesis potentially opening the types of routes for evolution of novel colicin-immunity pairs.<p>
