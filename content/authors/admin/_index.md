I am currently a PhD Candidate and GRFP Fellow in the [Kerr Lab](http://kerrlab.org/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). My overarching research interests are centered in bacterial plasmid biology investigating the effects of conjugative plasmids on the evolution and ecology of microbial communities.
