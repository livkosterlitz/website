  abstract  = "Multidrug resistance (MDR) of pathogens is an ongoing public
               health crisis exacerbated by the horizontal transfer of
               antibiotic resistance genes via conjugative plasmids. Factors
               that stabilize these plasmids in bacterial communities
               contribute to an even higher incidence of MDR, given the
               increased likelihood that a host will already contain a plasmid
               when it acquires another through conjugation. Here, we show one
               such stabilizing factor is host-plasmid coevolution under
               antibiotic selection, which facilitated the emergence of MDR via
               two distinct plasmids in communities consisting of Escherichia
               coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae once antibiotics were removed. In
               our system, evolution promoted greater stability of a plasmid in
               its coevolved host. Further, pleiotropic effects resulted in
               greater plasmid persistence in both novel host-plasmid
               combinations and, in some cases, multi-plasmid hosts. This
               evolved stability favoured the generation of MDR cells and
               thwarted their loss within communities with multiple plasmids.
               By selecting for plasmid persistence, the application of
               antibiotics may promote MDR well after their original period of
               use.",
